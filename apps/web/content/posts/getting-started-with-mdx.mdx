# Getting Started with MDX

MDX is the perfect choice for creating rich blog content with React components.

## What is MDX?

MDX allows you to use JSX in your markdown content. This means you can import and use React components directly in your content files.

### Features of MDX

- Use React components in markdown
- Import other components
- Export metadata from the file
- Use JavaScript expressions

## Code Syntax Highlighting

```javascript
// This code will be syntax highlighted
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet("MDX User"));
```

## Custom Components

You can use custom components in your MDX files:

<Callout type="info">
  This is a custom callout component that provides additional information in a
  styled box.
</Callout>

## Feature List

- **Frontmatter**: YAML metadata at the top of MDX files
- **Components**: Use React components in markdown
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Code blocks are automatically highlighted
- **TOC**: Table of contents is automatically generated

## Math Equations

You can also include math equations using LaTeX syntax:

E = mc^2

## Conclusion

MDX is a powerful tool for creating rich, interactive blog content that combines the simplicity of markdown with the flexibility of React.
