# Advanced MDX Techniques

Once you're comfortable with the basics, it's time to explore more advanced MDX features.

## Dynamic Content

You can use JavaScript expressions to create dynamic content:

```jsx
export const year = new Date().getFullYear();

<p>This blog post was last updated in {year}.</p>;
```

## Custom Layout Components

MDX allows you to create specialized layout components:

```jsx
<div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
  <div>Column 1 content</div>
  <div>Column 2 content</div>
</div>
```

## Interactive Elements

You can add interactive elements like buttons and forms:

```jsx
export const Counter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
};

<Counter />;
```

## Importing Data

You can import data from other files:

```jsx
import data from "../data/example.json";

<p>There are {data.items.length} items in the dataset.</p>;
```

## Conditional Rendering

You can conditionally render content:

```jsx
export const isAdmin = true;

{
  isAdmin && <p>This content is only visible to admins.</p>;
}
```

<Callout type="warning">
  Be careful with conditional rendering in MDX. It can make your content harder
  to maintain if overused.
</Callout>

## Conclusion

These advanced MDX techniques allow you to create rich, interactive blog posts with dynamic content and custom components.
